# Minecraft Snake Jump [Spigot-Extension]

This is an extension for the Minecraft server software called Spigot. Blocks follow a path of mushrooms like snakes: the whole thing in the air. The aim is to jump from snake to snake. Why snake? Because the blocks move along the path and the last block disappears into nothingness. Don't fall down!

I initially found this on the well-known Minecraft server called Mineplex (eu.mineplex.com).

## Some screenshots
You'll see two screenshots. Made with a short distance.

And seconds later... the snake keeps moving!
